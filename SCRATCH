Ok!
I could have a render dispatcher in argon
-Initialized on init, creating a list of types/renderers
-Has a method 'Draw' that takes a 'Drawable'
-Looks up methods type in list, and calls the correct renderer

NOTE: This is solved by the interface actually...

Maybe instead, the interface should have setShader, and setRenderer, allowing it to be user plugable
-In that vein, the getAttributes, and getData are needed for seperate package renderers
