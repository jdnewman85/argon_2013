Potential handled cases for default renderer interface
	Slice of Pointers to Struct
	Pointer to Struct
	Struct

What about method chaining to help with VAO/opengl?
Possibly returning different types for added safety
	Bindable Interface
		Methods requiring a bind could call it
	OR Bound Interface
		Bind returns a Bound object, which the other methods can be called on
		This would almost require casting to match current bound state?
			Note: Doesn't sync previous instances of this 'Bindable' to know they are bound
