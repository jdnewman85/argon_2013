May continue work on shader class
	Change LoadFromFiles to accept multiple files, or possibly wildcharacters and load/compile/attatch all
	Remove the gl.CreateProgram from the LoadFromFiles?
	Add a function that creates/loads all shaders/compiles and links all in one function?
		Possibly this is the LoadFromFiles, and a similar LoadFromFile only does one?
	Determine tpe of shader based on file extension?
Move the Uniform stuff into the shader class
Textures
Uniform Buffer Ojbects
Batches
Batch Manager?
